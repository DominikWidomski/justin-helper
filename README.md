# justin-helper
CLI tool for justin, ultimately to be automated and plug into slack.


## TODO:

- [ ] Use this for projects select: https://github.com/mokkabonna/inquirer-autocomplete-prompt
- [ ] There's a date plugin for date select
- [ ] Indicate Authenticating, show email, maybe progress and success âœ…
- [ ] getting project name - is this about relating records together in client, could give that a go.
- [ ] Automated testing!
- [ ] `-i` flag, for actually asking prompts, otherwise autorun the whole thing to repeat next day.
- [ ] `-e` flag to interactively only edit the next entry, run everything as otherwise expected.
- [ ] Default to 7h for day, and to remainder of the time if multiple projects in day.
- [ ] continuous process, not just one entry at a time.
